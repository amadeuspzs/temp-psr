This may be a new project built from scratch, or a continuation of a project that we have released as Open Source on our [Github](https://github.com/nhsx).\n","\n","### What is the goal of this exercise?\n","\n","This is not a Google coding interview. The goal is to ensure sufficient proficiency with the data science tools required for this project, but above all, the **ability to learn quickly, and experiment**.\n","\n","* Feel free to Google/Stackoverflow for help during this process (\"open book\")\n","* Don't worry about completing all the exercises during the alloted time.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","\n","* You will be presented with a number of activities below\n","* Read the tasks carefully, and when you're ready, start coding.\n","* The focus is the process and the way you approach the problem. There is no expectation that a highly accurate model will be produced as part of these exercises, instead the aim is understand your methodology.\n","* There will be plenty of time to discuss the way you tackled the exercises and how you would have done it differently with more time.\n","\n","\n","## Exercise 1 - Working with pandas"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UoC0745ggMrY"},"source":["# 1.1 Load the dataset\n","\n","# 1.2 Give a quick overview of summary statistics for continuous variables in the dataset\n","\n","# 1.3 Check for missing values - any action needed?\n","\n","# 1.4 Calculate the mean Length of Stay for each category of 'Severity of Illness'\n","\n","# 1.5 Visualise distribution of Length of Stay\n","\n","# 1.6 Store a .csv file of all patients in the 'TB & Chest disease' department.
